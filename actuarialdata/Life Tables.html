I. Introduction
</p>
<a name="wp1168562"> </a><p class="pBody">
Each year, estimates of future income and expenditures of the Old-Age, 
Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program are presented to the
 Congress in the Annual Report of the Board of Trustees. These estimates
 illustrate possible scenarios of the future financial position of the 
OASDI program, under present law, and thus are valuable in the policy 
making process for the program.
</p>
<a name="wp1168563"> </a><p class="pBody">
To produce these financial estimates, projections of the population in 
the Social Security coverage area are needed. One of the essential 
components of population projections is a projection of mortality, which
 is the subject of this study. For the 2005 Trustees Report, three 
separate projections—intermediate, low cost, high cost—were prepared. 
These projections are based on three different sets of assumptions about
 future death rates. The intermediate projections reflect the Trustees' 
best estimate of future experience. All mortality projections presented 
in this study are from the intermediate projections of the 2005 Annual 
Report of the OASDI Board of Trustees. These projections were also used 
in estimating the future financial status of the Hospital Insurance (HI)
 and Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) programs as described in the 
2005 Annual Report of the Medicare Board of Trustees.
</p>
<a name="wp1168564"> </a><p class="pBody">
Mortality rates are presented in this study in the context of life 
tables, which are commonly used by actuaries and demographers. Tables on
 both period and cohort bases are included. These tables supersede those
 published in Actuarial Study Number 116, which were used in the 
preparation of the 2002 Annual Reports
</p>
<a name="wp1168565"> </a><p class="pChapter">
II. Basic Concepts
</p>
<a name="wp1168566"> </a><p class="pBody">
A life table is a concise way of showing the probabilities of a member 
of a particular population living to or dying at a particular age. In 
this study, the life tables are used to examine the mortality changes in
 the Social Security population over time.
</p>
<a name="wp1168567"> </a><p class="pBody">
An ideal representation of human mortality would provide a measure of 
the rate of death occurring at specified ages over specified periods of 
time. In the past, analytical methods (such as the Gompertz, Makeham, or
 logistic curves) satisfied this criterion approximately over a broad 
range of ages. However, as actual data have become more abundant and 
more reliable, the use of approximate analytical methods have become 
less necessary and acceptable. Today, mortality is most commonly 
represented in the form of a life table, which gives probabilities of 
death within one year at each exact integral age. These probabilities 
are generally based on tabulations of deaths in a given population and 
estimates of the size of that population. For this study, functions in 
the life table can be generated from the q<sub class="cSubscript">x</sub>, where q<sub class="cSubscript">x</sub>
 is the probability of death within a year of a person aged x. Although a
 life table does not give mortality at non-integral ages or for 
non-integral durations, as can be obtained from a mathematical formula, 
acceptable methods for estimating such values are well known.
</p>
<a name="wp1168568"> </a><p class="pBody">
Two basic types of life tables are presented in this study, period-based
 tables and cohort-based tables. Each type of table can be constructed 
either based on actual population data or on expected future experience.
</p>
<a name="wp1168569"> </a><p class="pBody">
A period life table is based on, or represents, the mortality experience
 of an entire population during a relatively short period of time, 
usually one to three years. Life tables based directly on population 
data are generally constructed as period life tables because death and 
population data are most readily available on a time period basis. Such 
tables are useful in analyzing changes in the mortality experienced by a
 population through time. If the experience study is limited to short 
periods of time, the resulting rates will be more uniformly 
representative of the entire period. This study presents period life 
tables by sex for decennial years 1900 through 2000 based on United 
States and Medicare data, and for decennial years 2010 through 2100 
reflecting projected mortality.
</p>
<a name="wp1168570"> </a><p class="pBody">
A cohort, or generation, life table is based on, or represents, 
mortality experience over the entire lifetime of a cohort of persons 
born during a relatively short period of time, usually one year. Cohort 
life tables based directly on population experience data are relatively 
rare, because of the need for data of consistent quality over a very 
long period of time. Cohort tables can, however, be readily produced, 
reflecting mortality rates from a series of period tables for past 
years, projections of future mortality, or a combination of the two. 
Such tables are superior to period tables for the purpose of projecting a
 population into the future when mortality is expected to change over 
time, and for analyzing the generational trends in mortality. This study
 presents cohort life tables by sex for births in decennial years 1900 
through 2100, reflecting the mortality experience and projections 
described above.
</p>
<a name="wp1168571"> </a><p class="pBody">
A life table treats the mortality experience upon which it is based as 
though it represents the experience of a single birth cohort consisting 
of 100,000 births who experience, at each age x of their lives, the 
probability of death, denoted q<span style="vertical-align: sub">x</span>, shown in the table. The entry l<sub class="cSubscript">x</sub> in the life table shows the number of survivors of that birth cohort at each succeeding exact integral age. Another entry, d<sub class="cSubscript">x</sub>,
 shows the number of deaths that would occur between succeeding exact 
integral ages among members of the cohort. The entry denoted L<sub class="cSubscript">x</sub> gives the number of person-years lived between consecutive exact integral ages x&nbsp;and x+1 and T<sub class="cSubscript">x</sub>
 gives the total number of person-years lived beyond each exact integral
 age x, by all members of the cohort. The final entry in the life table,
 <sub><sub><img src="Life%20Tables_files/LifeExp_html.gif" id="wp1171432" alt="Life Expectancy" vspace="0" hspace="0" border="0"></sub></sub>,
 represents the average number of years of life remaining for members of
 the cohort still alive at exact integral age x, and is called the life 
expectancy.
</p>
<a name="wp1168572"> </a><p class="pBody">
The l<sub class="cSubscript">x</sub> entry in the life table is also 
useful for determining the age corresponding to a specified survival 
rate from birth, which is defined as the age at which the ratio of l<sub class="cSubscript">x</sub> to 100,000 is equal to a specified value between 0 and 1.
</p>
<a name="wp1168573"> </a><p class="pBody">
A stationary population is what would result if for each past and future year:
</p>
<div class="pSmartList1"><ul class="pSmartList1">
<a name="wp1168574"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>The probabilities of death shown in the table are experienced</li></div>
<a name="wp1168575"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>100,000 births occur uniformly throughout each year</li></div>
<a name="wp1168576"> </a><div class="pSmartList1"><li>The population has no immigration and emigration</li></div>
</ul></div>
<a name="wp1168578"> </a><p class="pBody">
A population with these characteristics would have a constant number of 
persons from year to year (in fact, at any time) both in their total 
number and in their number at each age. These numbers of persons, by age
 last birthday, are provided in the life table as the L<sub class="cSubscript">x</sub> values. The l<sub class="cSubscript">x</sub> entry is interpreted as the number of persons who attain each exact integral age during any year, and d<sub class="cSubscript">x</sub> is the number of persons who die at each age last birthday during any year. The entry T<sub class="cSubscript">x</sub> represents the number of persons who are alive at age last birthday x or older, at any time.

III. Construction of Central Death Rates
</p>
<a name="wp1168580"> </a><p class="pSection">
A. Data Sources
</p>
<a name="wp1168581"> </a><p class="pBody">
Annual tabulations of numbers of deaths by age and sex are made by the 
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) based on information 
supplied by States in the Death Registration Area, and are published in 
the volumes of <u class="cUnderline">Vital Statistics of the United States</u>.
 These are now available on the web at www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss.htm. Deaths
 are provided by five year age groups for ages 5 through 84, in total 
for ages 85 and older, and by single-year and smaller age intervals for 
ages 4 and under. One requirement for admission to the Death 
Registration Area, which since 1933 has included all the States, the 
District of Columbia and the independent registration area of New York 
City, was a demonstration of ninety percent completeness of 
registration. Because incentives for filing a death certificate are so 
strong (obtaining burial permits, collecting insurance benefits, 
settling estates, etc.) and because every State has adopted laws that 
require the registration of deaths, it is believed that errors of 
under-registration of deaths are insignificant for the nation as a 
whole. Errors of misstatement of age on the death certificate, however, 
may very well cause distortion in the distribution of numbers of deaths 
by age group.
</p>
<a name="wp1168583"> </a><p class="pBody">
Annual estimates of the U.S. resident population by single year of age 
and sex are made by the Census Bureau and are published in <u class="cUnderline">Current Population Reports</u>
 Series P-25. The most recent population information is available and 
updated regularly on the Census Bureau web site at www.census.gov. These
 estimates are affected by both undercount and misclassification in the 
decennial census. These errors, which may either offset or compound, are
 usually considered together as net undercount. Postcensal estimates are
 made by the "inflation-deflation" method which inflates the last 
previous census-level population by net undercount, carries the inflated
 population forward according to the births and deaths tabulated in the 
Vital Statistics, adjusts the population by estimated net immigration, 
and then deflates by net undercount. Thus, the postcensal population 
estimates are affected by errors in the Vital Statistics and the effect 
tends to accumulate as the elapsed time from the last previous census 
increases. When results of the following census become available, the 
postcensal estimates are revised, and are then called intercensal 
estimates, thus removing much of the effect of errors in Vital 
Statistics and in net immigration estimates. 
</p>
<a name="wp1168585"> </a><p class="pBody">
Central death rates calculated by comparing numbers of deaths tabulated 
by the National Center for Health Statistics to the mid-year population 
estimated by the Census Bureau are affected by the errors from both 
sources, which may either offset or combine. Further, errors of 
noncomparability of numerator and denominator may also be introduced. 
Although efforts are made to minimize errors of noncomparability (by 
excluding armed forces overseas from the population estimates, for 
example), complete comparability is intrinsically impossible. 
</p>
<a name="wp1168586"> </a><p class="pBody">
The errors of noncomparability can be eliminated if the numbers of 
deaths and the population are drawn from the same source. This approach,
 however, generally involves so large a reduction in the size of the 
population being observed, that more random error is introduced than 
noncomparability error is eliminated. One source of data on aged persons
 which is not subject to errors of noncomparability and yet does permit a
 very large number of observations, is Medicare program enrollment. 
Also, this source involves fewer errors of misstatement of age, because 
most of the data relate to individuals who have had to prove their date 
of birth to become entitled to benefits.
</p>
<a name="wp1168587"> </a><p class="pBody">
An error analogous to net undercount does appear to be present in the 
Medicare data, although the error is believed to have an insignificant 
effect on calculated death rates, except for the very aged (beginning at
 roughly age 95). This error stems from the presence in the data of 
"phantom records" which may have arisen because the person was 
registered in the program more than once, or because information about a
 person was miscoded when he/she registered, or because the person's 
death was not reported. Such phantom records are not of much concern to 
cost-conscious program administrators, however, because the Medicare 
program only pays benefits when bills for covered services rendered are 
submitted.
</p>
<a name="wp1168588"> </a><p class="pBody">
In an effort to reduce the number of phantom records, the Medicare based
 death rates calculated for years after 1987 were limited to the records
 of those Medicare participants who were also eligible for Social 
Security or Railroad Retirement monthly income benefits, or who were 
government employees or retirees with enough Medicare qualifying 
government employment. This limitation eliminated approximately three 
percent of the Medicare records.
</p>
<a name="wp1168589"> </a><p class="pBody">
Data needed in order to project central death rates by cause of death 
were obtained from Vital Statistics tabulations for years since 1979. 
For the years 1979-1998, adjustments were made to the distribution of 
the numbers of deaths by cause. The adjustments were needed in order to 
reflect the revision in the cause of death coding that occurred in 1999,
 making the data for the years 1979-1998 more comparable with the coding
 used for the years 1999 and later. The adjustments were based on 
comparability ratios published by the National Center for Health 
Statistics. 
</p>
<a name="wp1168590"> </a><p class="pBody">
For the years 1900-1967, age-sex specific central death rates were 
calculated from NCHS Vital Statistics tabulations of deaths and Census 
estimates of populations. For the period 1968-2001 those same two 
sources were used for ages under 65, but records of the Medicare program
 were used to calculate rates for ages 65 and over. The numbers of 
deaths by cause from Vital Statistics tabulations were used to 
distribute the age-sex specific rates into age-sex-cause specific rates 
for the years 1979-2001.
</p>
<a name="wp1168591"> </a><p class="pSection">
B. Adjustments in Population
</p>
<a name="wp1168592"> </a><p class="pBody">
Populations in some five-year age groups for some years were estimated 
from published figures for broader age groups. Death Registration 
States' populations during 1900-1932 for five-year age groups, 5-9 
through 70-74, were estimated from the ten-year age groups, 5-14 through
 65-74, by assuming that the distributions of five-year age groups 
within ten-year age groups were as published for the United States 
resident population from the Census Bureau. Death Registration States' 
populations during 1900-1932, and United States population during 
1933-1939 for the age group 75-84, were distributed between the 75-79 
and 80-84 age groups by using linear interpolation of the age 
distributions from the Decennial Census enumerations. Death Registration
 States' populations during years 1900-1932 and United States population
 during years 1933-1967 for age groups 85-89, 90-94, and 95 and over 
were estimated by distributing the age group 85 and over using NCHS 
tabulated deaths for each year and Medicare data. The split of the 
conterminous United States populations aged 0-4 into age groups 0 and 
1-4 for the years 1950-1959 was estimated from the group 0-4 by assuming
 the same distribution as in the United States, Alaska, and Hawaii 
combined. For 1959, deaths occurring in Alaska were excluded from total 
deaths, so that the population of the conterminous United States could 
be used to calculate the death rates. For all years, deaths tabulated at
 "age unstated" were prorated across the tabulated age groups.

The fundamental step in constructing a life table from population data is that of developing probabilities of death, q<sub class="cSubscript">x</sub>,
 that accurately reflect the underlying pattern of mortality experienced
 by the population. The following sections describe the methods used for
 developing the rates presented in this actuarial study. These methods, 
as will be seen, vary significantly by age. Actual data permit the 
computation of central death rates, which are then converted into 
probabilities of death. Exceptions to this procedure include direct 
calculation of probabilities of death at young ages and geometric 
extrapolation of probabilities of death at extreme old age, where data 
is sparse or of questionable quality.

B. Death Rates at Ages 0 - 4
</p>
<a name="wp1168731"> </a><p class="pBody">
For the period 1940-2001, the probability of death at age 0 (q<sub class="cSubscript">0</sub>)
 was calculated directly from tabulations of births by month and from 
tabulations of deaths at ages 0, 1-2, 3-6, 7-28 days, 1 month, 2 months,
 ..., 11 months. For the period 1900-1939, that probability was 
calculated from the population central death rate at age 0 using the 
relationship between probabilities of death and central death rate 
determined by ordinary least squares regression on values for 1940-2001.
 After 2001, the probability was calculated from the population central 
death rate for age 0, assuming that the ratio of probability of death to
 central death rate measured for 2001 would remain constant thereafter.
</p>
<a name="wp1168732"> </a><p class="pBody">
For the period 1940-2001, probabilities of death at each age 1 through 4 (<sub class="cSubscript">1</sub>q<sub class="cSubscript">x</sub>,
 x=1,2,3,4) were calculated from tabulations of births by year and from 
tabulations of deaths at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years. For the period 
1900-1939, the probabilities were calculated from the population central
 death rate for the age group 1-4 using the relationship between 
probabilities of death and central death rate. After 2001, the 
probabilities were similarly calculated from the population central 
death rate for the age group 1-4.
</p>
<a name="wp1168733"> </a><p class="pBody">
Based on a comparison of values from the 1900-1902 and 1909-1911 U.S. 
Decennial Life Tables, we concluded that the regression relationships 
used to determine probabilities of death from population central death 
rates during 1900-1939 gave reasonable results. The ratios used to 
determine probabilities of death from population central death rates 
after 2001 are assumed to give reasonable results because those 
probabilities are very low and are projected to change relatively little
 over the projection period. The following are the coefficients of the 
linear equation (y = mx+b) used for estimating probabilities of death as
 functions of population central death rates.

During the first year of life, mortality starts at an extremely high 
level, which becomes progressively lower, unlike mortality at other ages
 which does not change very much within a single year of age. Thus, it 
is particularly important at age 0 to estimate accurately the pattern of
 mortality throughout the year of age, as described above, for the 
calculation of <span style="vertical-align: sub">1</span>q<span style="vertical-align: sub">0</span>. Computation of other life table functions, particularly L<span style="vertical-align: sub">x</span>, T<span style="vertical-align: sub">x</span>, and <sub><sub><img src="Life%20Tables_files/LifeExp_html.gif" id="wp1171432" alt="Life Expectancy" vspace="0" hspace="0" border="0"></sub></sub>
 requires an additional factor related to this pattern called the 
separation factor, which is the average fraction of a year not lived by 
those who die within the year. For each of the years 1940-2001 the 
separation factor at age 0 (<span style="vertical-align: sub">1</span>f<span style="vertical-align: sub">0</span>)
 was calculated directly from probabilities of death within the exact 
age intervals 0-1, 1-3, 3-7, and 7-28 days and 1-2, 2-3, ..., 11-12 
months. For each of the years 1900-1939 that separation factor was 
linearly interpolated between the factor for 1940 and the factor 
calculated from the 1900-1902 U.S. Decennial Life Tables. Tests using 
data from the 1909-1911, 1919-1921, and 1929-1931 U.S. Decennial Life 
Tables showed that this interpolation gave reasonable results. For years
 after 2001, the separation factor at age 0 was assumed to remain 
constant at the 2001 level. Because mortality does not change very much 
within each of the second through fifth years of life, a separation 
factor of � was assumed.

D. Death Rates at Ages 95 and Older
</p>
<a name="wp1169355"> </a><p class="pBody">
It has been observed that the mortality rates of women, though lower 
than those of men, tend to increase faster with advancing age than those
 of men. An analysis of the mortality of Social Security charter Old-Age
 Insurance beneficiaries has shown that at the very old ages mortality 
increased about five percent per year of age for men and about six 
percent per year for women. Probabilities of death at each age 95 and 
older were calculated as follows for men:

For women, the same formulas were used, except that 1.06 was substituted
 for 1.05. The larger rate of growth in female mortality would 
eventually, at a very high age, cause female mortality to be higher than
 male mortality. At the point where this crossover would occur, we set 
female mortality equal to male mortality.

E. Historical Trends and Projections
</p>
<a name="wp1169373"> </a><p class="pBody">
Any sound procedure for projecting mortality must begin with an analysis
 of past trends. In this actuarial study, the mortality experience in 
each year since 1900 has been summarized in age-adjusted central death 
rates in order to control for changes in the age distribution of the 
population. Rates were adjusted to the distribution of the 2000 U.S. 
resident census population. Final mortality data for both deaths and 
resident population, were available for years through 2001. Table&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Tbl_1.html#wp1229200">1</a> shows age-adjusted historical rates for 1900 through 2001.
</p>
<a name="wp1169374"> </a><p class="pBody">
An examination of the age-adjusted central death rates reveals several 
distinct periods of mortality reduction since 1900, as shown in Table <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Tbl_5.html#wp1012577">5</a>.
 During the period 1900-1936, annual mortality reduction summarized for 
all ages, averaged about 0.7 percent for males and 0.8 percent for 
females. During the following period, 1936-1954, there was more rapid 
reduction, averaging 1.6 percent per year for males and 2.4 percent per 
year for females. The period 1954-1968 saw a much slower reduction of 
0.7 percent per year for females and an actual increase of 0.2 percent 
per year for males. From 1968-1982 rapid reduction in mortality resumed,
 averaging 1.8 percent for males and 2.2 percent for females, annually. 
From 1982-2001, mortality rates decreased an average of 1.0 percent per 
year for males and 0.4 percent for females. More detailed analysis of 
average annual percentage reduction in age-adjusted central death rates 
for selected periods is shown in <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Tbl_5.html#wp1012577">5</a>.

For the entire period 1900 to 2001, mortality, summarized over all ages,
 declined at an average annual rate of 0.93 percent for males and 1.19 
percent for females. However, mortality has generally declined at a 
slower rate for older individuals, throughout the last century. Between 
1900 and 2001, the age-adjusted rates for ages 65 and older declined at 
an average annual rate of 0.59 percent for males and 0.84 percent for 
females.

For the period 1982-2001, the average annual rate of improvement for 
females was considerably less than that for males for most of the age 
groups shown in <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Tbl_5.html#wp1012577">5</a>.
 For earlier historical periods, the opposite is true, i.e., the average
 annual rate of improvement for males was generally less than that for 
females.

Table <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Tbl_5.html#wp1012577">5</a>
 compares historical and projected average annual percentage reductions 
in age-adjusted central death rates during selected periods. Future 
reductions for those under age 65 are projected to be relatively small 
compared with past reductions. Reductions for the aged are expected to 
continue at a relatively rapid pace, as further advances are made 
against degenerative diseases, such as heart and vascular disease. For 
males age 65 and older, the average projected rate of improvement over 
the period 2029-2079 (0.68 percent per year) is slightly higher than 
that experienced over the last century (0.59 percent per year). The 
projected rate of improvement for women age 65 and older for the period 
2029-2079 (0.66 percent per year) is slightly lower than that assumed 
for men (0.68 percent per year), and only about three-fourths the rate 
experienced by aged women over the last century (0.84 percent per year).
 This is consistent with the assumption that rates of mortality 
improvement for women, which had been faster than those for men until 
1982, would ultimately be slightly less than those for males. Evidence 
that improvement for females will not always be faster than for males is
 apparent in data for years since 1981. The rate of improvement in 
mortality for aged women averaged only 0.15 percent per year during the 
period 1982-2001. This amount was about one-fifth the average rate of 
improvement for aged men during this period (0.77 percent). Table <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Tbl_5.html#wp1012577">5</a>
 shows that, for all ages combined, the average rate of improvement 
under the intermediate alternative for the period 2029-2079 is 0.72 
percent per year for men and 0.68 percent per year for women.

Given these assumed average annual rates of reduction, the actual 
projections of death rates are constructed on the basis of a consistent 
set of cause-specific ultimate rates of reduction. Toward this end, 
death rates for the years 1981-2001 were calculated and analyzed by age 
group and sex for the following seven groups of causes of death, based 
on the Tenth Revision of the International List of Diseases and Causes 
of Death code numbers:

Average annual percentage reductions in cause-specific death rates were 
calculated as the complement of the exponential of the slope of the 
least-squares line through the logarithms of the central death rates, 
multiplied by 100 to convert to percent form, and are given in Table <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Tbl_2.html#wp1012918">2</a>.
 The sharpest reductions for the 1981 to 2001 period were in the 
categories of Heart Disease, averaging 2.1 percent and Vascular Disease,
 which averaged about 1.9 percent reduction per year. The categories of 
Violence and Cancer averaged 0.9 percent and 0.2 percent reduction per 
year, respectively. On the other hand, the categories Respiratory 
Disease, Diabetes Mellitus and the residual group of Other causes 
actually averaged an increase of about 1.1 to 2.5 percent per year.

<a name="wp1169450"> </a><p class="pBody">
Ultimate annual percentage reductions in central death rates by sex, age
 group, and cause of death were postulated for years after 2029. The 
broad age groups for which specific rates of reduction were selected 
are: under age 15, ages 15-49, ages 50-64, ages 65-84, and age 85 and 
older. The postulated ultimate annual percentage reductions are shown in
 Table <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Tbl_3.html#wp1010727">3</a>.

Annual reductions in mortality by age, sex, and cause from 2001 to 2002 
and from 2002 to 2003, were assumed to equal the average annual 
reductions observed for the period 1981-2001. For years after 2003, the 
reductions in mortality were assumed to change from initial levels of 
100 percent of the average annual reductions observed for the period 
1981-2001, to the postulated ultimate percentage reductions shown in 
Table <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Tbl_3.html#wp1010727">3</a>,
 whenever these initial rates of reduction were positive. However, if 
the initial rates of reduction for a specific age, sex, and cause group 
were negative, the initial level was assumed to be 75 percent of the 
1981-2001 average annual reduction. To move from the initial level to 
the ultimate percentage reduction, a relative decrease in the difference
 to the ultimate reduction is moved each year. The postulated ultimate 
percentage reductions were assumed to apply after the year 2029.

Even though ultimate annual percentage reductions in central death rates are postulated for the seven causes listed in Table <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Tbl_3.html#wp1010727">3</a>,
 the resulting percentage reduction in age-adjusted central death rates 
for all causes combined are carefully reviewed, analyzed, and adjusted 
to assure consistency with the overall assumed rates of reduction. For 
each age and sex group, the decomposition of the percentage reduction by
 causes also provides a useful tool to test the reasonableness of the 
overall reduction.

calendar year), presents values for every tenth year from 1900 through 
2100. Table 7, the cohort table (by year of birth), includes every tenth

For each calendar year, or cohort, death rates are relatively high in 
the first year after birth, decline very rapidly to a low point around 
age 10, and thereafter rise, in a roughly exponential fashion, before 
decelerating (or slowing their rate of increase) at the end of the life 
span. Cohort tables show less rapid increase in the death rate with 
advancing age than do period tables because cohort tables reflect in 
succeeding ages the general improvement in health and safety conditions 
that occur over time. Conversely, period tables show more rapid increase
 in death rates with increasing age because calendar year experience for
 each higher age does not reflect the improved mortality of the 
succeeding years.

Table <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Tbl_8.html#wp1004907">8</a>
 presents a summary comparison of one-year probabilities of death for 
selected ages, by sex and calendar year. This allows a more detailed 
year-by-year analysis of the improvement in age specific death rates 
over time than was presented in Table 6. The greatest relative 
improvement in mortality during the twentieth century occurred at the 
young ages, resulting largely from the control of infectious diseases. 
For each sex, the probability of death at age 0 decreased 95 percent 
between 1900 and 2001 and a further reduction of about 83 percent is 
projected between 2002 and 2100. At age 30, the decrease between 1900 
and 2001 was 83 percent for males and 92 percent for females, reflecting
 the rapid decline in childbearing mortality experience for females. 
Over the period 2002-2100, further decreases of 58 and 51 percent for 
males and females respectively, are projected.

At ages 60, 65, and 70, shown in Table <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Tbl_8.html#wp1004907">8</a>,
 the probability of death decreased by about 55 percent for males and by
 over 65 percent for females between 1900 and 2001. Death rates are 
projected to decrease by about 55 percent for males and 50 percent for 
females in the 2002-2100 period. This large sex differential in 
mortality improvement is attributed partly to genetic factors and partly
 to environmental factors. If the genetic factors are more important, 
then the sex gap in mortality can be expected to remain large or even 
widen. If the environmental factors are more important, then the sex gap
 can be expected to close somewhat as women become increasingly subject 
to the same pressures and hazards as men. For example, during the period
 1970 through 1980 when great strides were made in treating degenerative
 diseases affecting the cardiovascular system, male mortality at age 65 
decreased 18 percent while female mortality decreased only 11 percent. 
Over the following 20-year period, from 1980-1999, male mortality at age
 65 continued to decrease faster than female mortality, with male 
mortality decreasing 30 percent and female mortality decreasing only 13 
percent. Increasing levels of tobacco use and job stress for women are 
expected to tend to narrow the gap in the future.

Table <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Tbl_10.html#wp1041324">10</a>
 presents life expectancy at selected ages, by sex and calendar year on a
 period basis. That is, life expectancy at a particular age for a 
specific year is based on the death rates for that and all higher ages 
that were, or are projected to be, experienced in that specific year. 
Life expectancy at age 0 for males increased 27.7 years from 46.4 years 
in 1900 to 74.1 years in 2001. During the same period, life expectancy 
at age 0 for females increased 30.5 years from 49.0 years to 79.5 years.
 Thus the sex gap in life expectancy at birth has increased from 2.6 
years in 1900 to 5.4 years in 2001. However, the sex gap has declined 
from a level of 7.8 years for 1973 and is projected to continue 
declining at a slow rate reaching a difference of 4.2 years in 2025.

From the mid 1950's through the early 1970's, male life expectancy at

moderately. During the 1970's faster improvement resumed for both males 
and females. Life expectancy for males and females in the 1980's

Little increase was experienced from 1900 to 1930. Since then, rapid

Table <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Tbl_11.html#wp1004907">11</a>
 shows, on a cohort basis, life expectancies at selected ages, by sex 
and year of birth. That is, life expectancy at a particular age for a 
specific year is based on death rates for that age in the specific year 
and for each higher age in each succeeding year. Life expectancies on a 
cohort basis tend to fluctuate less from year to year than do 
period-based life expectancies because of sudden and temporary events, 
such as a flu epidemic, which may affect the entire population, for a 
brief period of one or two years, but affect only one or two years of 
mortality experience for each of the cohorts alive during the period. 
Therefore, cohort life expectancies are more useful in analyzing subtle 
and gradual generational trends in mortality.

Table <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Tbl_13.html#wp1004907">13</a> presents ratios of female to male values similar to those in Table <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Tbl_12.html#wp1004907">12</a>,
 but based on cohort life tables. The ratio of female to male life 
expectancy declines steadily at ages 0 through 70, for cohorts born 
after 1906. This again reflects the increase throughout that period in 
the ratio of female to male death probabilities at the important 
early-elderly ages. Declines in the ratio of female to male life 
expectancy at age 100 reflect the past and projected increases in the 
ratio of female to male death probabilities at very high ages.

Table <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Tbl_14.html#wp1046284">14</a>
 presents the age for three selected survival rates, by sex and calendar
 year on a period basis. The median of the inverse survival distribution
 increased 22.6 years, from 55.2 years for males in 1900 to 77.8 in 
2001. For females the increase was 24.6 years, from 58.2 years in 1900 
to 82.8 years in 2001. Increases in life expectancy between 2002 and 
2100 are projected to be 8.2 years for males and 6.2 years for females.

Figure 4a shows median lifetime by sex and calendar year, based on 
period life tables. The shapes of the survival function at S(x) = .5 are
 similar to the shapes of the life expectancy curves at age 0, except 
that increases are smaller.

Table <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Tbl_14.html#wp1046284">14</a>
 shows that for the survival rate = 0.00001, the corresponding age for 
males increased from 104.4 years in 1900 to 109.8 years in 2001, while 
for females it increased from 104.9 years to 112.0 years. From 2002 to 
2100, the age for males is expected to increase by 8.2 years and for 
females by 7.3 years. This trend runs counter to the widely held belief 
that the age attained by the oldest survivors in the population has 
risen little, if at all, during the twentieth century.

Figure 4b shows the extreme old age, age x such that S(x) = 0.00001, by 
sex and calendar year, based on period life tables X, such that S(x) = 
0.00001 increased very little from 1900 through 1930. Between 1930 and 
1954, and again between 1963 and 1982, saw a rapid increase in age. 
Since 1982, age x for S(x) = 0.00001 has decreased for both males and 
females. For the period 2001-2100, x such that S(x) = 0.00001 is 
projected to briefly continue to decline then begin to rise steadily and
 slowly at about 0.1 year per year for males and 0.05 year per year for 
females.

Figure 5 presents the population survival curves based on period life 
tables for selected calendar years. Great strides were made in the 
twentieth century toward eliminating the hazards to survival which 
existed at the young ages in the early 1900's. Very little additional 
improvement to survival rates is possible at these young ages. Survival 
rates at the older ages are projected to continue to improve steadily. 
Projected gains in the probability of surviving to age 90 during the 
next 50 years are about the same as experienced during the past 50 
years. For age 100, projected gains are much greater than for the past. 
Figure 5 shows population survival curves based on period life tables 
for, from left to right, 1900, 1950, 2000 and projected years 2050 and 
2100.

<a name="wp1169498"> </a><p class="pBody">
Although the shape of the survivorship curve has become somewhat more 
rectangular (less diagonal) through time, it appears that very little 
additional rectangularization will occur because survival rates are 
already so high at the young ages and are expected to continue 
increasing at older ages. The so-called "curve squaring" concept, though
 appealing to many, simply cannot be supported by the mathematics of 
mortality. The age at which the survivorship curve comes close to zero, 
through the compounding of single-year probabilities of survival, has 
increased greatly during the twentieth century and will continue to 
increase, as further strides are made against degenerative diseases. 
That mortality rates are found to continue to decline, at every age for 
which adequate data are available, demonstrates that no absolute limit 
to the biological life span for humans has yet been reached, and that 
such a limit is unlikely to exist.
